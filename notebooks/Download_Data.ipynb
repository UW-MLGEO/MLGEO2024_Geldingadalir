    "The dataset consists of seismic data collected from a single horizontal component (BHN) of the AV.GSTD station located on the Great Sitkin Volcano. The data is recorded continuously over a period of 100 days, capturing the seismic activity before, during, and after the volcanic eruption.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Formats\n",
    "1. **MSEED (Mini-SEED) Files**:\n",
    "    - The seismic data is stored in Mini-SEED format, which is a compact binary format used for storing time series data. Each file contains a day's worth of seismic data, including metadata such as the sampling rate and station information.\n",
    "    - Example file name: `1_sitkin.mseed`, `2_sitkin.mseed`, ..., `100_sitkin.mseed`.\n",
    "2. **Numpy Arrays**:\n",
    "    - The dates corresponding to each day's seismic data are stored in a numpy array and saved as a CSV file (`date_list.csv`). This array helps in mapping the MSEED files to their respective dates.\n",
    "    - Example: `dates = np.array([datetime.date(2021, 5, 16), datetime.date(2021, 5, 17), ...])`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Processing\n",
    "- The raw seismic data is downloaded using the ObsPy library from the IRIS/Earthscope Database.\n",
    "- The data is merged and interpolated to fill any gaps, ensuring a continuous time series.\n",
    "- The processed data is saved in the MSEED format, preserving both the time series and metadata.\n",
    "\n",
    "This structured approach ensures that the seismic data is well-organized and easily accessible for further analysis and processing."
